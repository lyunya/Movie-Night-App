# Movie Night
---
### Movie Night App was developed to help you and your friends decide what movie to watch together.
---
## Description
#### During the Coronavirus pandemic, I was having virtual movie night parties with friends. One problem we kept having was trying to decide what to watch amongst the group. I decided to create this app that will allow everyone in the group to vote for thier choice. The app will show you which movie got the most votes. You can also create lists for different nights/groups of friends.
